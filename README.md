# George's Music Library Project

## Description
In this project, I will be learning how to use PostgreSQL, Docker, pgAdmin4 alongside Express.js to create an API that allows for CRUD interactions with a PostgreSQL databse.

Using TDD, I have created an API that allows a user to add artists and albums to a music library database. The user could then search for items in the library, edit the details, and delete items from the library.
